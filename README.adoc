== Codegen

Generated sources are already checked into git for learning purposes.

To generate new Pkl sources, first install the Swift code generator:

[source,bash]
----
curl -L https://github.com/apple/pkl-swift/releases/download/0.2.0/pkl-gen-swift-macos.bin -o pkl-gen-swift
chmod +x pkl-gen-swift
----

With that installed, generate Swift sources via:

[source,bash]
----
pkl-gen-swift pkl/**.pkl -o Sources/Gen
----

== Running the server

To run the project call `swift run`.
